        <h2>Kevin Afable - Team Lead</h2>
        <p>
          Through difficult times, Kevin helped this team shine. Without his
          10,000+ hours logged in Minecraft, we surely would have been lost. The
          dedication he showed to that game, has transalted into the dedication
          he has showed to this team.

          Charles Montoya is a fitness enthusiast by day and rogue coder by
          night. He left his old life on Wall St. to pursue a future in software

        <h2>Charles Wallace - Developer</h2>
        <p>
          While Chase has a measily 3,500 hours in Minecraft in comparison to
          our fearless leader Kevin... He works hard in all interests in his
          life. Throughout his life, he has found interest in traveling,
          composing music, and writing code.
